  <h1>Welcome to TJ Wright's website!</h1>

  <h2>Who is TJ Wright, exactly?</h2>

    <p>My name is TJ Wright and my pronouns are he/him/his! The nickname "TJ" stands for Tyler Joseph. My parents decided to call me TJ after my godfather who also goes by TJ, although his full name is Thomas James. I am a senior student at UW-Madison studying political science in hopes of attending law school following my undergraduate education. I have created this website to share a little bit about myself!<p>

    <p>I was born and raised in St. Paul, Minnesota, but I have also lived in Spain and Wisconsin during my life. In my free time I love listening to music, traveling wherever I can, and staying active by playing basketball or riding my bike! I love riding my bike around the UW-Madison campus, especially along the lakeshore path where there is beautiful scenery with the lake and the trees. I have 3 brothers, each of whom has also attended the University of Wisconsin-Madison, so we are a badger family. My family even has a pet cat named Bucky, after Buckingham Badger! We also have another pet cat named Franklin as well as two pet dogs. Most of my family's pets were rescued from animal shelters. I am an absolute animal lover and I am passionate about helping animals in need. I would suggest for anyone to look into adopting a pet in need or even donating money to an organization that works to shelter animals and help animals in need, whether it be dogs, cats, or any other type of animal. If you would like to learn more about helping animals in need in Wisconsin, or if you are thinking about potentially adopting and rescuing one of these animals, please visit: <a href="https://www.underdogpetrescue.org" target="_blank">https://www.underdogpetrescue.org</a></p>
