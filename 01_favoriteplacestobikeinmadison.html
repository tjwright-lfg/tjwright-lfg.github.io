  <h1>My Favorite Places to go Biking in Madison, Wisconsin</h1>

  <h2>Lakeshore Path</h2>

    <p>The lakeshore path is definitely my favorite place to ride my bike in the city of Madison, Wisconsin. Not only is the path the ideal distance for me to ride my bike, but the scenery along the path is amazing!<p>

    <p>Biking along the lakeshore path, starting at UW-Madison's Hasler Laboratory of Limnology and going to the very tip of Picnic Point, provides the perfect distance for which I can ride my bike, whether it be for a leisurely ride or for moving at a physically-demanding pace in order to exercise. Additionally, there are sights to see along the way. During the fall especially, the trees along the path turn to beautiful colors and it is nice to ride the path along the shore of Lake Mendota. All things considered, the lakeshore path makes for my ideal bike ride!</p>

  <h2>Downtown near the Wisconsin State Capitol</h2>

    <p>Biking down State Street to the Wisconsin State Capitol makes for an excellent bike ride, as it allows riders to see the wonderful architecture of the city as well as the wonderful people! I enjoy biking downtown near the capitol because I can get a real sense of the Madison community by seeing all the people out and about, especially when the weather is nice. Additionally, biking downtown near the capitol gives me an appreciation for the physical attributes of the city of Madison. The various shops, restaurants, and the capitol itself make for a beautiful backdrop for any bike ride!</p>
